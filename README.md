# Todo App JS

## About
**Heads up -- This app has no backend so your projects and tasks will be deleted once you close the browser page.**

You can use this app to keep track of projects that need to be completed. Simply create a project and then add tasks to that project. Once you have completed a task, check the box next to it to mark it as completed.

If you don't like a project or a task, click the delete button next to it to delete it.

## Project Goals
Solidify core JavaScript concepts such as organising code, using NPM and webpack etc.

## Other Notes
I wansn't entirely happy with the result of this project. My code itself and the whole file structure is a little messy. However I tried to adhere to SOLID concepts as much as possible.

If I remade this project I would plan it out more thoroughly first as it turned out to be more complicated than I anticipated.
